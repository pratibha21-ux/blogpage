subtitle: "Oranges, whose flavor may vary from sweet to sour, are commonly peeled and eaten fresh raw as a dessert. Orange juice is obtained by squeezing the fruit on a special tool (a juicer or squeezer) and collecting the juice in a tray or tank underneath. This can be made at home or, on a much larger scale, industrially."

firstdescription: "The propagation of grapevines is an important consideration in commercial viticulture and winemaking. Grapevines, most of which belong to the Vitis vinifera family, produce one crop of fruit each growing season with a limited life span for individual vines. While some centenarian old vine examples of grape varieties exist, most grapevines are between the ages of 10 and 30 years. As vineyard owners seek to replant their vines, a number of techniques are available which may include planting a new cutting that has been selected by either clonal or mass (massal) selection. Vines can also be propagated by grafting a new plant vine upon existing rootstock or by layering one of the canes of an existing vine into the ground next to the vine and severing the connection when the new vine develops its own root system."

Frozen orange juice concentrate is made from freshly squeezed and filtered juice."

fourthdescription: "3D printing is changing the course of the fashion business along the lines of cutting-edge processes on bespoke and doorstep tailoring. With the use of this technology, designers are able to develop deeper and more advanced patterns as well as geometric shapes that are impossible with the conventional methods. For brands such as Xpress Style, which are into clothes making as per the need of the clients, use of 3D printing provides an added advantage of making the most imaginative and unique clothes."
